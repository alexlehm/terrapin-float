terrapin-float: Fork of terrapin.sourceforge.net

This is a Turtle Graphics library for Processing (processing.org).

The code works with a float implementation, apparently I forgot to change the README when I commited that.

The project could use a bit of cleanup plus it needs a build file, previously I only build it inside Eclipse
and exported the class files to a jar, that is a bit complicated to automate.
